# Shirt-Name-Generator
The purpose of this code is to create a simple interactive program that generates a fun and personalized "shirt name" for the user. The code asks the user for two pieces of information: the name of their favorite TV show and the name of their favorite dessert. It then combines these two inputs to suggest a potential band name.
